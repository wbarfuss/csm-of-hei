    "In this part, we cover dynamic-systems models. They operationalize **systems knowledge**, typically understood as knowledge concerning the existing system or issue. This understanding is primarily analytical and descriptive. For instance, in the context of sustainability transitions, systems knowledge assesses the risk triggering climate tipping points, biodiversity loss dynamics, or a specific region's social-ecological dynamics. \n",

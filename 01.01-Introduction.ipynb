    "* Understanding and promoting **sustainability transitions** requires a **coupled human-environment systems approach**, as the **challenges** and possible **solutions** are **tightly coupled** between humans and the biosphere. \n",
    "* Limited human information processing demands us to model the world around us. **Formal models help overcome imprecise mental models and cognitive limitations**. Models are **helpful** for *understanding*, *communicating*, *predicting*, and *making decisions*. **Good models** are *coherent*, *transparent*, and *sparse*.\n",
    "* **Systems reductionism complements classical reductionism** to **avoid unintended side effects** in complex systems. Complex systems are characterized by **interactions, emergent properties, and feedback loops**.\n",
    "* Complex systems models of human-environment interactions must account for the **dynamics** of the **collective behavior** emerging from **cognitive agents** in **environmental contexts**. Three types of models, *dynamic-systems model*, *target-equilibria models*, and *transformation-agency* (agent-based) model, will help us achieve these desiderata.\n"

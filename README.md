These notes offer a comprehensive and opinionated, but foremost, practical introduction to the field of complex systems modeling applied to human-environment interactions and sustainability transitions.

## Learning goals

* Students can **model** *human-environment interactions* <br>to answer relevant questions in sustainability science.
* Students can **implement** *models of human-environment interactions* <br> in the
general-purpose computer language **Python**.
* Students can critically **evaluate** *models of human-environment interactions* <br>to judge their
relevance to issues in sustainability science.

## Acknowledgements
I am grateful to everyone whose writings and teachings influenced my thinking. I am thankful to all contributors and creators of the Python language and its ecosystem, which made this work possible. Furthermore, I acknowledge many helpers who may use some form of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Github Copilot, and Grammarly. All remaining errors remain my own.

This is version 0.1. To be updated and improved.
